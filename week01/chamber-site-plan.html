Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Sans-serif
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I selected the sans-serif font because it is a web safe font and it is
        easy to read on screens.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Roboto
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Roboto font gives the text a more modern and appealing look.
