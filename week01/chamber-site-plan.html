      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        I am a student majoring in computer engineering, and I love basketball,
        particularly the NBA. Although I love staying up to date with what is
        happening in the NBA, my responsibilities make it difficult. Knowing
        that many people face similar dilemmas, I decided to build a website
        where busy NBA fans can have easy access to the most interesting and
        relevant information in the NBA, including news, game results, and
        standings.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My audience consists of college students who enjoy keeping up with the
        NBA. These people are remarkably busy with their studies and other
        responsibilities. These people want a reliable place where they can go
        whenever they have time, to find updates from all over the league,
        especially their teams. They will most likely be accessing the website
        through their laptops and smartphones. They will check the website
        during their study breaks, and they will spend most their time on the
        website at the end of the day when they are winding down.
      </p>

      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:

        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Sans-serif
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I selected the sans-serif font because it is a web safe font and it is
        easy to read on screens.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Roboto
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Roboto font gives the text a more modern and appealing look.

        Where do you go when you only have a 10 minute break to find out what is
        going on in the NBA? How can you make sure you do not have to worry
        about FOMO? What was the score from last night's game? This website is
        designed to help NBA fans keep up with their favorite basketball league
        despite their busy schedules and different responsibilities. The goal of
        this website is to help all of its visitors quickly catch up with the
        NBA and find the most relevant information from the NBA when they manage
        to get a breather. This website will be your go to site to find out the
        latest and most relevant NBA transfers and rumors, scheduled games,
        final game scores, and more. Since you might not have 2 hours and 30
        minutes to watch the full games as often as you would like, you will
        want to watch the 9 to 13 minute game highlights on our page. One of the
        things that separates our page from others is that while most pages are
        designed to make you spend a high amount of time on there, our page is
        designed to give you what you want quickly, without endlessly scrolling
        through the site. You do not have to provide any information in order to
        use the website.
